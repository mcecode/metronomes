# Metronomes

This is a demo app I created to explore different ways I found and thought of to implement metronomes in JavaScript. You can find the accompanying article I wrote explaining the thought process behind each one and where I got them [here](https://mce.codes/writings/every-way-to-create-a-metronome-in-javascript).
